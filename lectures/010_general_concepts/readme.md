# Introduction to Computers and Programming

## Principles of Computer Programming

- Computer hardware changes frequently - from room-filling machines with punch cards and tapes to modern laptops and tablets
- With these changes - the capabilities of computers increase  rapidly (storage, speed, graphics, etc.)
- Computer programming languages also change over time
    - Better Programming language theory including new programming techniques
    - New languages are created - old ones are sometimes updated
    - Improvements to programming language implementations
- There are hundreds of programming languages, why?
    - Different tools for different jobs 
      Some languages better suited for certain jobs
      Python – scripting, Javascript – web pages
    - Personnel preference and popularity
- This class is about "principles" of computer programming
    - Common principles behind all languages won't change, even though hardware and languages do
    - How to organize and structure data
    - How to express logical conditions and relations
    - How to solve problems with programs

## Programming Language Concepts

- Machine language
    - Computers are made of electronic circuits
    - Basic instructions are encoded by setting wires to "on" or "off"
        - Read data, write data, add, subtract, etc.
    - Binary digits represent on/off state of wires in a circuit
    - Machine language: which sequence of binary digits (circuit state) represents which computer instruction
        - Example instruction: 0010110010101101
    - Most CPUs use one of two languages: x86 or ARM
- Assembly language
    - Easier way for humans to write machine-language instructions
    - Use a sequence of letters/symbols to represent an instruction, instead of 1s and 0s. 
        - Example x86 instruction: `movq %rdx, %rbx`
    - **Assembler**: Translates assembly language code to machine instructions
        - One assembly instruction = one machine-language instruction
        - x86 assembly produces x86 machine code
    - Computers can only execute the machine code
- High-level language
    - More human-readable than assembly language
    - Each statement does not need to correspond to a machine instruction
    - Statements represent more "high-level" concepts, such as storing a value in a variable, not "machine-level" concepts like "read these bits from this address"
    - Most languages we program in are high-level (C, C#, Python...)
    - **Compiler**: Translates high-level language to machine code
        - Small programs in high-level language might produce lots of machine code
        - Compiler is specific to both the source language and the target machine code
    - Compile then execute, since computers can only execute machine code
- Compiled vs. Interpreted languages
    - Not all high-level languages use a compiler - some use an interpreter
    - **Interpreter**: Lets a computer "execute" high-level code by translating one statement at a time to machine code
    - Advantage: Less waiting time before you can run the program (no separate "compile" step)
    - Disadvantage: Program runs slower, since you wait for each high-level statement to be translated before the program can continue
- Managed high-level languages (like C#)
    - Combine features of compiled and interpreted languages
    - Compiler translates high-level statements to **intermediate language** instructions, not machine code
        - Intermediate language: Looks like assembly language, but not specific to any CPU
    - **Runtime** executes compiled program by *interpreting* the intermediate language instructions - translates one at a time to machine code
    - Advantages of managed languages:
        - In a "non-managed" language, a compiled program only works on one OS + CPU combination (**platform**) because it is machine code
        - Managed-language programs can be reused on a different platform without recompiling - intermediate language is not machine code and not CPU-specific
        - Still need to write an intermediate language interpreter for each platform (so it produces the right machine code), but in a non-managed language you must write a compiler for each platform
        - Intermediate-language interpreter is much faster than a high-level language interpreter, so programs run faster than an "interpreted language" like Python
    - This still runs slower than a non-managed language (due to the interpreter), so performance-minded programmers use non-managed compiled languages (e.g. for video games)


## Software Concepts

- Flow of execution in a program
    - Program receives input from some source, e.g. keyboard, mouse, data in files
    - Program uses input to make decisions
    - Program produces output for the outside world to see, e.g. by displaying images on screen, writing text to console, or saving data in files
- Program interfaces
    - **GUI** or Graphical User Interface: Input is from clicking mouse in visual elements on screen (buttons, menus, etc.), output is by drawing onto the screen
    - **CLI** or Command Line Interface: Input is from text typed into "command prompt" or "terminal window," output is text printed at same terminal window
    - This class will use CLI because it's simple, portable, easy to work with -- no need to learn how to draw images, just read and write text


## Programming Concepts

- Programming workflow (see flowchart)
    - Writing down specifications
    - Creating the source code
    - Running the compiler
    - Reading the compiler's output, warning and error messages
    - Fixing compile errors, if necessary
    - Running and testing the program
    - Debugging the program, if necessary
- Interpreted language workflow (see flowchart)
    - Writing down specifications
    - Creating the source code
    - Running the program in the interpreter
    - Reading the interpreter's output, determining if there is a syntax (language) error or the program finished executing
    - Editing the program to fix syntax errors
    - Testing the program (once it can run with no errors)
    - Debugging the program, if necessary
    - **Advantages**: Fewer steps between writing and executing, can be a faster cycle
    - **Disadvantages**: All errors happen when you run the program, no distinction between syntax errors (compile errors) and logic errors (bugs in running program)


#### Programming workflow 

<!-- TODO: title this figure -->

!["Flowchart demonstrating roles and tasks of a programmer, beta tester and user in the creation of programs."](img/flowchart)

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    - Combines a text editor, compiler, file browser, debugger, and other tools
    - Helps you organize a programming project
    - Helps you write, compile, and test code in one place
    - Visual Studio terms:
        - Solution: An entire software project, including source code, metadata, input data files, etc.
        - "Build solution": Compile all of your code
        - "Start without debugging": Run the compiled code
        - Solution location: The folder (on your computer's file system) that contains the solution, meaning all your code and the information needed to compile and run it
